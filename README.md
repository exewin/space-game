## Description

![alt text](https://github.com/exewin/space-game/blob/master/preview3.jpg)

  I focused mainly on programming and graphics therefore story in game is simplified. You play as a pilot of the spaceship and your mission is to destroy all enemy ships. You gain experience and new technologies through the gameplay. While you have to destroy hostiles, you must also watch out for their fire and deadly meteors. Yep, sounds very dull, but maybe some pictures can convince you to try it out (there is also gameplay in youtube, link is in the 'useful links' category):
